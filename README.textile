h1. GemTools

h2. DESCRIPTION:

The gem verison of my lightweight tool to manage gems using a config file, 
similar to GemInstaller.

My blog post on why "I prefer GemTools over config:gem":http://underpantsgnome.com/2009/4/8/i-prefer-gemtools-over-config-gem

h2.  FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Doesn't yet work in Windows

h2.  SYNOPSIS:

I use this to manage gem versions in my apps, it has a script to install gems 
and a load utility to load them on startup.

h3. create a gems.yml in a new project

  gemtools setup path/to/app

h3. Install or update required gems

  gemtools install
  
h3. Check to see if any of the gems in your app have newer versions

  gemtools check_update

Make sure they are loaded with the right versions during startup, by adding the 
following to your script or environment.rb (Rails)

  require 'gem_tools'
  GemTools.load_gems


See the "sample config":http://github.com/UnderpantsGnome/gem_tools/blob/master/gems.yml.sample for the format

h2.  INSTALL:

  sudo gem install gem_tools

h2.  TODO

  * Write the tests/specs
  * Make it work in Windows
